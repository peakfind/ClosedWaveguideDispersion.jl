## Structure of this documentation

1. **Tutorial** presents a basic framework for computing dispersion diagrams in 2D periodic closed waveguides. 
2. **Examples** contains problems with different domains or boundary conditions. This part can help you to implement your own code for compuation of disperison diagrams.
